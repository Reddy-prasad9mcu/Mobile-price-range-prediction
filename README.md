# 📱 Mobile Price Range Prediction

This project helps predict the **price range** of mobile phones based on features like RAM, memory, battery, etc. using **Random Forest Classifier**.

## 📂 Dataset
- Context: Bob, a mobile company founder, wants to predict the price category for his new phones.
- Features include RAM, Memory, Battery Power, Clock Speed, etc.
- Target is a **Price Range** (not exact price).

## 🛠️ What I Did
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Selection
- Model Building using RandomForestClassifier
- Achieved **R² Score ≈ 0.92**
- Final Predictions on Test Set

## 🚀 Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

## 📈 Results
- RandomForestClassifier achieved **high accuracy** and **R² ≈ 0.92**.
- Solid model ready for price range classification tasks.

## 🤖 Future Improvements
- Try GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Test other models like XGBoost, LightGBM.
- Build a small web app using Streamlit to make live predictions.
